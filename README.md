# HugoWebsite

Main folder for the https://afraderasola.github.io/ website. 

So far, I only had on github the /public folder of the website. It made it complicated to work on website content on other computers just to have the content creation folders only locally on the windows computer. 

Now, hopefully, I will manage to update the website from any platform.
