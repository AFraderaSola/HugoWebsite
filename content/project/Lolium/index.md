summary: Main M.Sc project - I developed a scoring function around three R-based RNA-Seq differential expression packages (DESeq2, edgeR, limma+voom). The main goal was to assess ow well packages perform and compare the their results in order to maximize (or restric, depenging on your criteria) the number of detected DEGs.
