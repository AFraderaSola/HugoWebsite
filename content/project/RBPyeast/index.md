summary: Main PhD project - RNA binding proteins (RBPs) were selected according to their involvement in RNA pathways and immunoprecipitated. This allowed us to create a function-based network that enabled the assignment of new functionalities on novel and known RBPs. This work was recently presented at CSAMA 2022.
