I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Proteomics in the Institute of Molecular Biology. My research interests focus on bioinformatics, especially omics data and its statistical analysis. My work revolves around analyzing NGS-based genomics and quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. I consider myself both collaborative and adaptable. I am always eager to tackle new and different projects. I am very enthusiastic to share and develop my data visualization skills as a means towards better science communication. I am an open-minded person and enjoy having great relationships with my colleagues.
