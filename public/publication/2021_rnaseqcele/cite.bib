  abstract = {Abstract                            Telomeres are bound by dedicated proteins, which protect them from DNA damage and regulate telomere length homeostasis. In the nematode               Caenorhabditis elegans               , a comprehensive understanding of the proteins interacting with the telomere sequence is lacking. Here, we harnessed a quantitative proteomics approach to identify TEBP-1 and TEBP-2, two paralogs expressed in the germline and embryogenesis that associate to telomeres in vitro and in vivo.               tebp-1               and               tebp-2               mutants display strikingly distinct phenotypes:               tebp-1               mutants have longer telomeres than wild-type animals, while               tebp-2               mutants display shorter telomeres and a Mortal Germline. Notably,               tebp-1;tebp-2               double mutant animals have synthetic sterility, with germlines showing signs of severe mitotic and meiotic arrest. Furthermore, we show that POT-1 forms a telomeric complex with TEBP-1 and TEBP-2, which bridges TEBP-1/-2 with POT-2/MRT-1. These results provide insights into the composition and organization of a telomeric protein complex in               C. elegans               .},
