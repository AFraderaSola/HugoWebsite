Genome maintenance is orchestrated by a highly regulated DNA damage response with specific DNA repair pathways. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic diversity in the recognition and repair of three well-established DNA lesions, primarily repaired by base excision repair (BER) and ribonucleotide excision repair (RER): (1) 8-oxoguanine, (2) abasic site, and (3) incorporated ribonucleotide in DNA in 11 species: Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Halobacterium salinarum, Trypanosoma brucei, Tetrahymena thermophila, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Zea mays. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified 337 binding proteins across these species. Of these proteins, 99 were previously characterized to be involved in DNA repair. Through orthology, network, and domain analysis, we linked 44 previously unconnected proteins to DNA repair. Our study presents a resource for future study of the crosstalk and evolutionary conservation of DNA damage repair across all domains of life.}
